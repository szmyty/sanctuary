# @Description  : Docker Compose setup file for the Sanctuary project.
#                 This file defines common configurations and includes
#                 service-specific Docker Compose files for a modular and
#                 maintainable architecture. It leverages Docker Compose's
#                 ability to dynamically include other YAML files, ensuring
#                 each service's configuration is isolated yet integrated.

# Define common labels for Docker objects that will be used across all services
# to maintain consistency in labeling Docker objects like containers and volumes.

  labels:
    app.name: ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME} # Name of the application, set using the Compose project name.

# Include external Docker Compose files for specific services. This approach helps in
# maintaining a clean and organized project structure, allowing individual service configurations
# to be modified independently without impacting other services.
