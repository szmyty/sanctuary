# ShellCheck configuration file
#
# This file contains configuration options for ShellCheck, a popular
# static analysis tool for shell scripts. It is used to identify
# potential issues, enforce best practices, and improve the overall
# quality of shell scripts. This configuration file is designed to
# be comprehensive and should cover most common scenarios encountered
# during script development.
#
# For more information about ShellCheck, visit: https://www.shellcheck.net/

# Set shell dialect to bash (default: bash)
# You can change this to 'sh', 'dash', 'ksh', or 'zsh' if needed.
shell=bash

# Enable warnings for all scripts, not just when ShellCheck is invoked from a terminal
# This is useful for CI environments or when ShellCheck is invoked programmatically.
# This option is the default and is included here for clarity.
external-sources=true

# Enable specific ShellCheck warnings
# These are the common warnings that help improve script quality.
# Add or remove based on your project needs.

# Set severity levels
# ShellCheck allows you to set different severity levels for different types of issues.
# These can be 'error', 'warning', or 'info'.
# The default severity level is 'warning'.

# ShellCheck ignores files/directories that match these patterns.
# You can add patterns to exclude specific files or directories.
exclude=.git
exclude=.svn
exclude=.hg
exclude=node_modules
exclude=vendor

# Ignore certain rules within specific files or directories
# You can use this section to apply specific ignores within certain parts of your project.
