# .asdfrc
# This file is used by asdf to configure global settings for the asdf version manager.
# The settings here affect how asdf operates across all projects.

# Set the path where plugins are installed.
# By default, this is set to $HOME/.asdf/plugins, but you can change it to a custom path.
# For example, to set it to a custom directory in the sanctuary project:
# plugin_path = "$SANCTUARY_DEVTOOLS_ROOT/plugins"
plugin_path = "$HOME/.asdf/plugins"

# Set the legacy version file behavior.
# If enabled, asdf will read legacy version files (like .ruby-version) to determine which version to use.
# By default, this is disabled.
# Set it to yes to enable reading legacy version files.
legacy_version_file = no

# Control whether asdf should resolve symlinks before checking the version.
# This is useful if you have symlinks pointing to different tool versions.
# The default is no.
resolve_symlinks = no

# Configure the shell used by asdf when running commands.
# By default, it uses the system's default shell.
# For example, you can set it to use bash explicitly:
# shell = "/bin/bash"
shell = "$SHELL"

# Set the default plugin repository to be used by asdf.
# By default, asdf uses https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins.git, but you can point it to a custom plugin repository.
# plugin_repository = "https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins.git"

# Control whether asdf will update plugins automatically when a new version is available.
# The default is no.
# auto_update_plugins = no

# Set the default path for asdf to install versions of tools.
# By default, this is set to $HOME/.asdf/installs, but you can change it to a custom path.
# install_path = "$SANCTUARY_DEVTOOLS_ROOT/installs"

# Enable/disable telemetry for asdf.
# By default, telemetry is disabled.
# telemetry = no

# Set the logging level for asdf commands.
# Available levels are "info", "warn", "error", and "debug".
# The default level is "info".
# logging_level = "info"

# If you want to force asdf to use shims, even if a globally installed binary is available,
# you can set this option to yes. The default is no.
# always_use_shims = no
