# File: pre-commit
#
# Purpose: Husky Git hook to ensure code quality before committing
#
# Description: This script is executed automatically by Husky before each commit.
#
# It runs linting, formatting, and any other checks to prevent bad code
# from being committed.
#
# Author: Alan Szmyt
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Best Practices:
# - Make sure this file is executable: `chmod +x .husky/pre-commit`
# - Customize the commands to suit your project's needs.
# - Ensure that each command has proper error handling and returns a non-zero exit code on failure.
# - Use environment variables or configuration files if needed for dynamic settings.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
set -e

# Print all commands before executing them (optional)
set -x

# Run linting (adjust the command based on your project's linting setup)
echo "Running lint checks..."
pnpm lint

# Run code formatting check (optional: depends on your project setup)
echo "Checking code formatting..."
pnpm format:check

# Run tests (optional: if you want to ensure tests pass before committing)
echo "Running tests..."
pnpm test

# If all checks pass, the commit will proceed
echo "All checks passed. Proceeding with commit."

# Exit with status 0 to allow commit
exit 0
