    Preamble

This agreement is a free software license whose objective is to
give users the freedom to modify and
redistribution of the software governed by this license under a
free software distribution model.

The exercise of these freedoms is accompanied by certain duties on the part of
users in order to preserve this status over the
subsequent redistributions.

Accessibility to source code and copy and modification rights
and the redistribution that results from it have the counterpart of not offering
to users only a limited warranty and not to impose any liability on
the author of the software, the holder of the property rights and the
successive grantors only limited liability.

In this regard, the user's attention is drawn to the risks
associated with the loading, use, modification and/or
development and reproduction of the software by the user being
given its specificity as free software, which can make it complex to
manipulate and therefore reserves it for developers or
knowledgeable professionals with computer skills
in-depth. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test
the suitability of the software to their needs under conditions allowing
to ensure the security of their systems and/or their data and, more
generally, to use and exploit it under the same conditions of
security. This contract may be freely reproduced and distributed, under
subject to keeping it as is, without adding or removing clauses.

This Agreement may apply to any software whose
holder of the property rights decides to submit the exploitation to the
provisions it contains.
