# European Union Public License 1.2 (EUPL 1.2)

## Description

This license works just like the European Union Public License (EUPL), but it is approved in 23 official EU languages as opposed to 22. Other than this, it is used in the same way, meaning that these two licenses can almost be interchanged with no inhibitions. They can also be used with other forms of covered code.
