## 3. Requirements

3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

-   a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it.

## 4. Commercial Distribution

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners, and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.

## 7. General
