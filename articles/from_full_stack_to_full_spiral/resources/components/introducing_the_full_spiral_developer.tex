    \section{Introducing the Full-Spiral Developer}

    Drawing inspiration from \textbf{Spiral Dynamics}\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics}{Spiral Dynamics on Wikipedia}}, a psychological model that explores human development, the \textbf{full-spiral developer} represents an evolution in how we approach our craft. It's not just about cycling through tasks but about ascending to new heights with each iterationâ€”integrating new knowledge, refining skills, and expanding our perspectives.

    As full-spiral developers, we embrace the entirety of the development process:

    % List of development processes.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Foundation:} Understanding the low-level workings of hardware and machine code.
      \item \textbf{Abstraction:} Writing efficient code in languages like C and leveraging scripting languages like Bash for automation.
      \item \textbf{Orchestration:} Utilizing tools like Terraform for infrastructure as code, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for container orchestration.
      \item \textbf{User Experience:} Designing intuitive user interfaces and ensuring seamless user interactions.
      \item \textbf{Personal Growth:} Continuously learning, reflecting, and integrating new philosophies and methodologies into our practice.
    \end{itemize}
