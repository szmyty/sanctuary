    I've always been fascinated by the idea of creating a seamless, push-to-start system—a solution so intuitive that deploying infrastructure and applications becomes as simple as pressing a button. This quest led me down a path of introspection about the layers of abstraction we navigate as developers. From the physical hardware and machine code to assembly languages like C, up through Bash scripts and orchestration tools, each layer represents a loop in our development journey.

    But as I pondered this concept further, I realized that our progression isn't just a loop—it's a spiral. Each iteration doesn't just bring us back to the starting point; it elevates us to a new level of understanding. This realization inspired the idea of the \textbf{full-spiral developer}. A developer who doesn't just traverse the layers of abstraction but spirals through them on a specific journey, continuously evolving and expanding their knowledge.
