    % Abstract
    \begin{abstract}
      \textit{In the ever-evolving world of technology, the role of the developer
      has expanded far beyond traditional boundaries. This article explores
      the journey from being a full-stack developer to embracing the concept
      of a full-spiral developer - a holistic approach that intertwines technical
      expertise with personal growth and continuous learning. We'll delve into
      how abstraction layers, DevOps practices, and philosophical perspectives
      like Spiral Dynamics converge to redefine what it means to be a developer
      today.}
