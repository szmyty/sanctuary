    % Abstract
    \begin{abstract}
      In the ever-evolving world of technology, the role of the developer has expanded far beyond traditional boundaries. This article explores the journey from being a full-stack developer to embracing the concept of a full-spiral developerâ€”a holistic approach that intertwines technical expertise with personal growth and continuous learning. We'll delve into how abstraction layers, DevOps practices, and philosophical perspectives like Spiral Dynamics converge to redefine what it means to be a developer today.
