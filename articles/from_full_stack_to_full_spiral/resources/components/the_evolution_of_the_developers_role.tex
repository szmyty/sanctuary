    \section{The Evolution of the Developer's Role}

        Traditionally, the term \textbf{full-stack developer} refers to someone proficient in both back-end and front-end technologies. However, in today's complex technological landscape, this definition feels somewhat limiting. Modern development encompasses a broader spectrum—including infrastructure as code, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), cloud services, and user experience design.

        As we integrate DevOps practices and infrastructure management into our workflows, the term \textbf{full-loop developer} emerges. This concept captures the cyclical nature of development, where we continuously iterate or loop through coding, testing, deploying, and monitoring.

        But even this feels incomplete. The loop suggests a closed cycle, yet our experiences and skills don't just cycle—they build upon each other. Each pass through the loop adds a new layer of depth, much like the threads of a spiral weaving upwards.
