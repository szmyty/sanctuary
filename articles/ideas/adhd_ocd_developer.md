# Balancing ADHD Context Switching and OCD Perfectionism as a Software Developer

## The Battle Within: Flow vs Perfection
As a software developer with ADHD and OCD-like tendencies, life often feels like a game of power dynamics between two opposing forces:

1. **ADHD Context Switching**: Like a sorting algorithm visualized in motion, my brain rapidly switches between tasks, ideas, and priorities. This constant motion creates creative sparks but can overwhelm focus.
2. **OCD Perfectionism**: A relentless pull toward perfection, this force demands refinement, organization, and optimization. It pushes me toward building something truly "perfect," but often at the expense of forward momentum.

## The Flow State: A Moving Target
The flow state becomes a delicate balance between these two forces:
- **Perfectionism** provides a guiding direction, like a magnetic north.
- **Context Switching** fuels creativity and exploration but can scatter progress.
- The challenge lies in harmonizing these forces, focusing on *flow over perfection* to sustain productivity and creative momentum.

## Visualization as the Next Step
This internal dynamic could be visualized as a 3D sorting algorithm:
- Imagine blocks constantly shifting positions, pulled by an invisible force of perfectionism while being nudged by the chaos of context switching.
- The goal: to illustrate the journey of finding balance and flow.

## Next Steps
1. Write a Medium article exploring the experience of ADHD and OCD in software development.
2. Create a **3JS visualization** of the sorting algorithm metaphor to enhance the article.
3. Share insights about balancing creativity, productivity, and mental health in tech.

*Finding balance is not about silencing these forces but allowing them to work together in harmony, creating space for both exploration and structure.*

### Notes
- Focus on flow as a theme: "Progress over perfection."
- Incorporate examples from personal experiences as a developer and creative thinker.
- Visualization could be interactive, showing real-time dynamics of flow and perfection.
